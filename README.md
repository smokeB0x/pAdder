A group of scripts that pads possible passwords with numbers and symbols, and also makes the words upper- and lower-case.

Add the list of possible passwords to the root file (here where this readme-file is)

Name the file "passordliste.txt"

Run the file "run.cmd" by double clicking it

You will now have a file named "passord-final.txt" (This might take some time, depending on how large the initial list is).

To change the numbers to padd with, edit the py-script "merger3.py"

To change the symbols to padd with, edit the py-script "symbols.py"

Each of the 3 scripts can be modified and used on its own if needed

Examples of before and after:
Initial list: 75 words, final list: 77 000 words
Initial list: 250 000 words, final list: 240 000 000 words
