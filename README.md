# pAdder

A script that pads possible passwords with numbers and symbols, and also makes the words upper- and lower-case.

Add the list of possible passwords to the root file (here where this readme-file is)

Name the file "passwords.txt"

Run the file "pAdder_2.0.py" 

You will now have a file named "final_passwords.txt" (This might take some time, depending on how large the initial list is).

To change the numbers to padd with, edit the digits list in the function "add_numbers"

To change the symbols to padd with, edit the symbols in the function "add_symbols"

Examples of before and after:
Initial list: 75 words, final list: 77 000 words
Initial list: 250 000 words, final list: 240 000 000 words
